Course Description
------------------

Discrete math is the study of objects that can be built from zeroes and ones. These are the objects that computers can manipulate effectively. They include numbers and graphs but also logical statements and computer programs. We will introduce methods for reasoning about discrete structures, including mathematical proofs, invariants, and recurrences and touch upon applications like public-key encryption and backpropagation.

  

Course information
------------------

*   **Schedule:** Lectures are held on We 10-11.20 and Fr 8.30-9.50 in MHN 257. Tutorials are on Th 5.30-6.50 in STE H0104. You are expected to attend in person. In case of emergency I will try to broadcast live at [this link](https://uottawa-ca.zoom.us/my/abogdano).
*   **Grading:** Your grade is determined by the quizzes (30%), the midterm exam (30%), and the final exam (40%). Your lowest two quiz grades will be dropped from the count. There are no makeup quizzes.
*   **Discussion board:** There is a [discussion board on piazza](https://piazza.com/class/lr16u6uvh6b3tz). Please register and sign in using your uOttawa email address.
*   **Textbook** The primary reference is [_Mathematics for Computer Science_](https://eng.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Computer_Science/Programming_and_Computation_Fundamentals/Mathematics_for_Computer_Science_\(Lehman_Leighton_and_Meyer\)) by Lehman, Leighton, and Meyer. Notes will be provided for material not covered in the textbook. The book [_Discrete Mathematics and Applications_](https://mhhe.com/rosen) (7th edition) by Kenneth Rosen can be used as a secondary reference and a source of additional exercises.
